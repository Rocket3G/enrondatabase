## Installation

In order to run this installation, you need to have the Neo4J database server running on port 7474. After you've done that, you need the enron dataset, placed at dataset/maildir.
You should also run `bundle` in order to install missing gems.

## Running

In order to run this, Neo4J needs to be open, accepting requests on port 7474. Then you can just run `ruby main.rb` in order to run it. It will start parsing them right away. :smiley:
